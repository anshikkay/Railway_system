## ðŸ”— Relationships
- **One train type â†’ Many trains**
- **One station â†’ Can be part of many routes**
- **One train â†’ Many stops in `train_routes`**
- **One passenger â†’ Many journeys**

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
- Passwords should be stored in hashed format.
- The `train_count` column in `train_type` is currently `DATE`, which should ideally be `INT` for counting trains.
- The schema enforces **referential integrity** using `FOREIGN KEY` constraints.
